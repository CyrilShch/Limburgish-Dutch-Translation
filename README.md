# Limburgish-Dutch-Translation

Machine translation has recently achieved impressive performance-gains due to advances in deep learning and
large parallel corpora. These resulted in almost human-level
translation. In an effort to achieve similar result for low-resource
languages, that do not have large parallel corpora, researchers
have explored the potential of unsupervised machine translation.
For this project we gathered a data-set of both Dutch and
Limburgish in similar domains before training a Cross-lingual
Language Model. It was able to achieve a BLEU score of 31.73
for Limburgish to Dutch, and a 20.21 BLEU score for Dutch to
Limburgish
